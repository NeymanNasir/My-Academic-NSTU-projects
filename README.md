# Honors Academic Project.
This was our honor's final year project. Here, we proposed an alternative method for basic feasible 
solution of transportation problem. we mainly worked here for balanced transformation problem; we studied all previous algorithms, finally tested a number of cases for our proposed algorithm and found some good results(min cost) as well. 

My contribution: Implemented the algorithm in Python and collaborated in idea generation as well.
